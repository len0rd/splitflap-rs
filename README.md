# splitflap-rs

Code rewrite for ScottBez1's [splitflap display project](https://github.com/scottbez1/splitflap/) in Rust. For fun and learning.

## Hardware Target

An ESP32 'TTGO' (with T-Display) is the target hardware for this project as this is the default board for the parent project.

## Development

It is easiest to do development from within a container for [esp32 rust](https://hub.docker.com/r/espressif/idf-rust/tags). For convenience, a [VSCode devcontainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) using this image is provided.
